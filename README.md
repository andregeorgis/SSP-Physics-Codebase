Python scripts that plot the graph of an equation using matplotlib

The code itself is heavily commented in case someone that has little programming experience needs to read this :stuck_out_tongue:

project.py is the Python script used for the equation in image "equation_simple.png"

project_optimisation is the Python script used for the equation in image "equation_complex.png"
